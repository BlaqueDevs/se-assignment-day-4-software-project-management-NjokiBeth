# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial as it ensures that a software project remains within the specified scope, for example budget, meets stakeholder expectations and still is competitive in the market since delays can lead to financial losses, dissatisfied clients and missed deadlines. 
To ensure deadlines are met, project managers can use agile methodologies for iterative development, Gantt charts for creating project schedules and tracking milestones, can identify risks early, can monitor progress using tools such as Trello and Jira and can ensure that there is clear communication between teams and stakeholders.



## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control ensures that a project is financially viable while at the same, maintaining its intended value to prevent cost overruns that were not budgetted for hence leading to project cancellation and reduced profitability.
Strategies to prevent budget overruns include defining a clear budget with realistic estimates, using cost estimation techniques, managing scope creeps by controlling the changes, handling resource allocation correctly to avoid unnecessary expenses and negotiating contracts wisely with vendors, for example.



## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
1. Agile is iterative and flexible while waterfall is structured and sequential.
2. Agile is highly adaptable to changes while waterfall is rigid and difficult to change scope.
3. Testing for agile is continuous and integrated while for waterfall, it is done at the end after development.
4. Client and customer involvement for agile is high with regular feedback while for watefall, it is limited to final stages.

Advantages of agile:
1. Faster delivery of the working software.
2. Adaptable to changes.
3. Encourages client feedback.
Disadvantages of agile:
1. Requires high team collaboration.
2. Less focus on documentation.

Advantages of waterfall:
1. Clearly defined scope and milestones.
2. Strong documentation.
3. Easy to manage especially for predicatble projects with predictable output.
Disadvantages of waterfall:
1. Inflexible to changes.
2. Late testing might cause severe damages.
3. Longer development time.



## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial for startups, software with uncertain requirements, highly collaborative projects and evolving projects such as social media platforms and SaaS platorms.
Waterfall is more beneficial for projects with fixed requiremenst and mission-critical systems such as government IT systems and banking software.



## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for ensuring quality assurance include through automated testing such as unit, integration e.t.c, code reviews to ensure best practices, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and user feedback for quality improvements.
Maintaining high standards ensure customer satisfaction, reduced maintenance costs and compliance with industry regulations and standards.



## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
A clear scope prevents scope creep and ensures that the system focuses on the requirements.
A WBS is a hierarchical breakdown of tasks. It helps track progress effectively, ensures no critical task is missed and assigns clear responsibilities to team members.



## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed project scope prevents misssed deadlines, allocates resources efficiently and enhances risk management. 
Gantt charts help this by visualizing the project timelines and identifcation of bottlenecks at an early stage.



## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The core issues are that many pregnant women lack acess to timely prenatal checkups and limited internet access prevents digital health solutions from working effectively.
The problems are significant to the target audience by providing a low-cost and accessible alternative to avoid using the internet by using the USSD option.



## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem ensures the solution adresses the major pain points, prioritizes the key features and improves user satisfaction based on the problem.



## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
A USSD bases health reminder system that ensures expectant mothers in rural areas receive prenatal care, get reminders on dates of giving birth, fetal and nutritional information and vaccination alerts- without needing internet access.



## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
1. Automated health reminders via USSD.
2. Emergency alerts for maternal complications.
3. Access to healthcare in case of emergencies and alerts.



## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
1. Kenya's maternal mortality rate : 355 deaths per 100,000 live births in February 2024. (UNFPA Kenya)
2. Mobile penetration in rural Kenya : 75% of households have a basic phone. (CAK)
Growth potential: NGOs and public health organizations can fund and scale the system. Can alse be expanded to address other healthcare issues such as child immunization reminders.



## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Increased funding in digital health solutions makes it easy to secure partnerships. Growing mobile usage in rural areas makes USSD the right choice.
